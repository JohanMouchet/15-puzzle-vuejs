# 15 Puzzle Vue.js

This mini-game is called a "15 Puzzle". Learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

## To play the game
Head over the [GitHub page](https://johanmouchet.github.io/15-puzzle-vuejs/index.html)

Or, download / clone the project and open `index.html` in a browser.

## About the tech
This implementation is realised in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Which I'm fairly new to.

I intentionally choose to not use the vue-cli or any task runner to keep it as simple and lightweight as possible.

Because I used some modern ES6, and CSS3 features, without transpiling / preprocessing them, the app might not work in older browsers.
